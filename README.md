How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to keep it simple. A piece of software is made from smaller programs. I understand the big picture first, and then build the components that make the big picture.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
In computer graphics it is important to understand how primititve objects work together to create more complex objects. Being able to identify the primitive objects in a scene is an essential design skill.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process was to follow the outline set up in the course. The course split the project into different categories each week. This made it easy to learn a new subject each week and then apply it in my own project.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Keeping things simple and working in small chunks at a time are two tactics that I will utilize going forward.

How do I approach developing programs?
A program is one of the building blocks of software. When I develop a program it is usually as a piece of larger piece of software. You have to understand the big picture and how the program fits into the larger picture. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I don't think I tried any new strategies.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is one of the most important development tools a programmer has. I am constantly changing and running my code to see how my changes make the program respond. Sometimes it takes many iterations of changing and running before I achieve the results I am looking for. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach has remained relatively the same throughout the milestones.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is the domain of knowledge that encapsulates the information needed to be successful in software engineering. It doesn't contain every skill I'll need to be succussful but the more I learn from this domain the better of a software engineer I will be. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
See below for answer to this question.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Even if I do not plan to enter a field that requires me to use computational graphics the act of applying the openGL interface in my own code and generating a 3D scene shows that I have the ability to read documenation and succesfully build something with it. This is a useful skill in both eduction and future professional pathways.
